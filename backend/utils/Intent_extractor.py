You are an intent extraction agent. Your job is to parse the user’s natural language request and extract structured metadata that will be used to generate a PromQL query.

Extract the following fields:
- intent: The monitoring goal (e.g., cpu_usage, memory_consumption, network_traffic, request_latency)
- resource_type: The Prometheus resource (e.g., pod, node, container, namespace, endpoint)
- aggregation_level: The level of aggregation, such as “by (pod)”, “by (instance)”, or “sum” if none is specified.
- time_function: Either “rate”, “irate”, or “none” (if time-based rate is not needed)
- metric_scope: A short phrase summarizing the metric family (e.g., http request, disk usage, memory stats)

Return in JSON format. Do not include any explanation.

Examples:

Input:
"CPU usage across all nodes"

Output:
{
  "intent": "cpu_usage",
  "resource_type": "node",
  "aggregation_level": "by (instance)",
  "time_function": "rate",
  "metric_scope": "node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!=\"idle\"}"
}

---

Input:
"95th percentile HTTP latency by endpoint"

Output:
{
  "intent": "request_latency",
  "resource_type": "endpoint",
  "aggregation_level": "by (le, endpoint)",
  "time_function": "rate",
  "metric_scope": "http_request_duration_seconds_bucket"
}

---

Now extract from this user input:
"{{user_query}}"





You are a PromQL generation agent. Your input is a JSON object that describes the query components extracted from natural language. Use this structure to construct a correct PromQL expression.

Rules:
- If `time_function` is "rate" or "irate", apply it as `rate(metric[5m])` or `irate(metric[5m])`
- If `aggregation_level` includes "by (...)", use it after the aggregation function.
- Use `sum`, `avg`, or `histogram_quantile` depending on the intent.
- For latency metrics with `"bucket"` in `metric_scope`, use `histogram_quantile`.
- For percentages, apply `(A / B) * 100` format.
- Omit container="" filters unless explicitly required.
- Do not add comments or formatting. Return only the PromQL expression.

Examples:

Input:
```json
{
  "intent": "cpu_usage",
  "resource_type": "node",
  "aggregation_level": "by (instance)",
  "time_function": "rate",
  "metric_scope": "node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!=\"idle\"}"
}

def get_promql_examples(keyword: str) -> list:
    prompt = f"""
You are a Prometheus monitoring expert.

Your task is to generate highly relevant and optimized PromQL expressions based on a single infrastructure-related keyword provided by the user.

The keyword may refer to key concepts such as:
- CPU
- Memory
- Disk I/O
- Latency
- Network traffic
- HTTP error rates
- Uptime
- Pod restarts
- Namespace usage
- Cluster availability

Rules:
1. Return only valid PromQL expressions enclosed in a JSON-like Python list (no markdown or additional text).
2. Each PromQL expression should be syntactically correct and follow Prometheus best practices.
3. Provide **2 to 4** expressions for each keyword.
4. Ensure that the expressions span different aggregation levels such as:
   - By pod
   - By node
   - By namespace
   - By cluster
5. Use the appropriate PromQL functions like `rate()`, `avg()`, `sum()`, or `histogram_quantile()` where needed.
6. Do not include explanations, comments, or markdown — just the list.
7. If no relevant PromQL can be generated, return an empty list: `[]`.

Now process the following:
Keyword: "{keyword}"
    """

    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",  # or "gpt-3.5-turbo"
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.3
    )

    raw = response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()
    try:
        return json.loads(raw)
    except Exception as e:
        print("❌ Failed to parse:", raw)
        return []

# Example usage
print(get_promql_examples("cpu"))
