You are a PromQL expert. Convert the following natural language query into an accurate PromQL query.

Return only the PromQL expression.

Examples:
"Show CPU usage across all nodes" → avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{{mode!="idle"}}[5m])) by (instance)
"Memory usage per pod" → sum(container_memory_usage_bytes{{container!=""}}) by (pod)

Now convert this:
"{user_query}"
"""




You are a PromQL expert helping a {{role}} build efficient Prometheus dashboards.

Based on the scope: "{{scope}}", and the user request: "{{user_query}}", generate the most accurate PromQL query.

Only return the PromQL query. Do not include explanations.

If the query needs aggregation (e.g., sum or avg), apply it over the correct label like `pod`, `namespace`, or `instance` depending on the scope.

Examples:

- Role: SRE | Scope: node level | Query: "CPU usage"
  → avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode!="idle"}[5m])) by (instance)

- Role: Kubernetes Admin | Scope: pod level | Query: "Memory usage"
  → sum(container_memory_usage_bytes{container!=""}) by (pod)

- Role: DevOps Engineer | Scope: cluster-wide | Query: "Disk usage"
  → sum(node_filesystem_size_bytes - node_filesystem_free_bytes)

Now generate PromQL for:
- Role: {{role}}
- Scope: {{scope}}
- Query: {{user_query}}

Return only the PromQL.
